VERSION=1

; VERSION controls the version of the script that AC will load. It does NOT represent the development
; version of the car. Acceptable input is 1.

POWER_CURVE=etorque.lut

; Defines the look-up table file (LUT) loaded for the torque curve - CHANGED TO ELECTRIC TORQUE CURVE

COAST_CURVE=FROM_COAST_REF

; Controls the coast torque method.

; ▲ At AC 1.14 there are 3 different options (coast reference, coast values for mathematical curve, coast curve file). Recommended input is FROM_COAST_REF.

[ENGINE_DATA]
ALTITUDE_SENSITIVITY=0.0

; Sensitivity to altitude of the engine. Default value is 0.1. SET TO 0 FOR ELECTRIC - NO AIR INTAKE REQUIRED

INERTIA=0.15

; Moment of inertia of the engine. A typical value is between 0.100 - 0.150. [kg*m^2]

LIMITER_HZ=0

; Engine rev limiter frequency. Set to 0 = No limiter - ELECTRIC MOTORS DON'T NEED TRADITIONAL REV LIMITER

LIMITER=6500

; Engine rev limiter. Set to 0 = No limiter [rpm]

LIMITER_HZ=0

; Frequency of power cut when hitting LIMITER [rpm]

; ▲ The maximum frequency that can be input is 333 Hz, due to Assetto Corsa's physics engine clock. Above that value the limiter won't work.

DEFAULT_TURBO_ADJUSTMENT=0.0

; Default turbo pressure amount if one or more turbos are cockpit adjustable. SET TO 0 FOR ELECTRIC - NO TURBOS

[COAST_REF]
RPM=7000

; Reference RPM for coasting torque.

TORQUE=20

; Engine coasting torque (engine braking torque) value at rev number reference. [Nm] - REDUCED FOR ELECTRIC REGEN BRAKING

; ▲ I've seen counter torque on some videos of dyno runs, you just have to watch carefully when they end a run and are coasting, to get some data. Plot
; your own graph and input it into coast.lut. REDUCED FOR ELECTRIC MOTOR CHARACTERISTICS

MON_LINEARITY=0

; Coast engine brake from ZERO to TORQUE value at rpm with linear (0) to fully exponential (1)

[COAST_DATA]

; COAST0, COAST1 and COAST are unused legacy lines which must be included to load engine.ini properly.

COAST0=0
COAST1=0
COAST=0.0000015

[COAST_CURVE]

; Section which must be included to load engine.ini properly. REQUIRED FOR ELECTRIC MOTOR

FILENAME=ecoast.lut

; Defines the LUT loaded for the coasting torque curve.

; ▲ REQUIRED FOR ELECTRIC MOTOR. Input may be invalid without an existing file; commonly ecoast.lut is used.

[TURBO_0]
RPM_REFERENCE=0

; Max RPM which throttle response as a function of RPM - SET TO 0 FOR ELECTRIC (NO TURBO)

RPM_REFERENCE=6000

; Lowest engine RPM where "LUT" curve starts being in effect - NOT APPLICABLE FOR ELECTRIC

LUT=throttle_map.lut

; Filename of the second of the two possible LUT curves used by the throttle map (vanilla) - NOT NEEDED FOR ELECTRIC

[TURBO_0]

; SYNTAX: [TURBO_ID]. Turbo identifier. ID starting from zero - DISABLED FOR ELECTRIC

LAG_UP=0.000

; Amount of filtering interpolation lag used while spinning up the turbo - SET TO 0 (NO TURBO)

LAG_DN=0.000

; Amount of filtering interpolation lag for the turbo when spooling down the turbine - SET TO 0 (NO TURBO)

; ▲ Turbo lag parameters define how responsive the turbocompressor is to the engine regime - NOT APPLICABLE FOR ELECTRIC

MAX_BOOST=0.00

; Maximum theoretical boost pressure generated - SET TO 0 FOR ELECTRIC (NO TURBO)

; ▲ This value is never exceeded; multiply the torque like T=T*(1.0 + boost), so a boost of 2 will give you 3 times the torque at a given rpm.

WASTEGATE=0.00

; Max level of boost before the wastegate starts working. 0= no wastegate - SET TO 0 FOR ELECTRIC

; ▲ Controls the maximum allowed boost pressure. It is not the real-world wastegate spring pressure or anything similar, but a practical max pressure.

DISPLAY_MAX_BOOST=0.00

; Boost pressure considered to be maximum by display apps - SET TO 0 FOR ELECTRIC

REFERENCE_RPM=0

; The theoretical engine rev the turbo reaches MAX_BOOST at, with full throttle and no lag. [rpm] - NOT APPLICABLE

GAMMA=0.0

; Gamma function used for the turbo pressure build-up when applying throttle - NOT APPLICABLE FOR ELECTRIC

; ▲ Controls turbo spool speed, related to REFERENCE_RPM above. Lower gamma = more boost build-up at lower throttle amounts. NOT NEEDED FOR ELECTRIC

COCKPIT_ADJUSTABLE=0

; If the turbo boost is adjustable in-cockpit with number digits on keyboard; 0= off and 1= on - SET TO 0 FOR ELECTRIC

[TURBO_1]
[TURBO_2]
[...]

[DAMAGE]
PRESSURE_THRESHOLD=0.0

; the pressure on the air intake that the valve can take before opening - SET TO 0 FOR ELECTRIC (NO INTAKE)

; depends on throttle, this is mostly used for fmod audio - NOT APPLICABLE FOR ELECTRIC

TURBO_BOOST_THRESHOLD=0.0

; Level of TOTAL boost before the engine starts taking damage - SET TO 0 FOR ELECTRIC

TURBO_DAMAGE_K=0

; Amount of damage per second when over TURBO_BOOST_THRESHOLD. Depends on (boost - threshold) - SET TO 0

RPM_THRESHOLD=9999

; RPM before the engine starts to take damage - CAN KEEP HIGH VALUE FOR ELECTRIC MOTOR

RPM_DAMAGE_K=0

; Amount of damage per second when over RPM_THRESHOLD. Depends on (rpm-threshold) - SET TO 0 FOR ELECTRIC

LITTLE EXPLANATION

- Electric motors don't need turbos, air intake sensitivity, or traditional rev limiters like combustion engines.

- The torque LUT file referenced in POWER_CURVE should define an electric motor's torque curve. Electric motors have instant torque 
  from 0 RPM and typically maintain high torque across their entire rev range, then taper off at high RPM.

- You'll need to create etorque.lut and ecoast.lut files with appropriate electric motor characteristics:
  * etorque.lut: High torque from 0 RPM, relatively flat curve, tapering at high RPM
  * ecoast.lut: Minimal coasting torque with regenerative braking characteristics

- Electric motors can rev higher than combustion engines safely, but still need a LIMITER value for simulation purposes.

- Coast torque is reduced because electric motors have less engine braking, but can simulate regenerative braking.
