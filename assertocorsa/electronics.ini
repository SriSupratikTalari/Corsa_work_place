VERSION=1

; This config file manages the behaviour of the various real-life electronic devices of the vehicle in our simulation: ABS (Anti-lock Braking System), TCS
; (Traction Control System) and EDL (Electronic Differential Lock).

[ABS]
SLIP_RATIO_LIMIT=0.10

; Slipratio limit before ABS engages.

CURVE=abs.lut

; Slipratio lookup table with different slipratio limits, in order to define ABS levels if present.

; ▲ Leave the value completely blank if you wish for a single level given by the SLIP_RATIO_LIMIT line above.

PRESENT=1

; =1 if ABS is present on the car, =0 if not present. SET TO 1 FOR ELECTRIC (modern EVs have ABS)

; ▲ ABS always works if ABS assist is activated from the realism menu UI.

ACTIVE=1

; =1 the car starts with ABS on (if present), =0 the car starts with ABS off (even if present). SET TO 1 FOR ELECTRIC

; ▲ You can toggle this value on and off in-game with Ctrl+A.

RATE_HZ=100

; ABS pulse frequency. It's better to insert the actual ABS pumps refresh rate, than the ECU and
; sensors frequency

[TRACTION_CONTROL]
SLIP_RATIO_LIMIT=0.08

; Slipratio limit before TC engages - REDUCED FOR ELECTRIC (more aggressive TC for instant torque)

CURVE=traction_control.lut

; Slipratio lookup table with different slipratio limits, in order to define TC levels if present.

; ▲ Leave the value completely blank if you wish for a single level given by the SLIP_RATIO_LIMIT line above. ctrl+T to toggle

PRESENT=1

; 1 if present in car, 0 if not present (TC always work if TC assist is activated from realism menu UI) - SET TO 1 FOR ELECTRIC

ACTIVE=1

; 1 will make the car start with TC active (if present), 0 will make the car start with TC inactive - SET TO 1 FOR ELECTRIC
; (even if present). ctrl+T to toggle

RATE_HZ=100

; TC pulse frequency. It's better to insert the actual TC pumps refresh rate, than the ECU and sensors
; frequency

MIN_SPEED_KMH=5

; Traction control is set automatically OFF under the min speed value in km/h even if selected as
; assist by the user. REDUCED FOR ELECTRIC (active at very low speeds for instant torque control)

[EDL]
PRESENT=0

; 1 if present in car, 0 if not present (TC always work if TC assist is activated from realism menu UI) - SET TO 0 (NOT NEEDED WITH PROPER ELECTRIC DRIVETRAIN)

ACTIVE=0

; 1 will make the car start with TC active (if present), 0 will make the car start with TC inactive
; (even if present). SET TO 0

MAX_SPIN_POWER=0.8

; Brake torque ramp on power. 0=no difference, 1=fast wheel twice the speed of slow wheel

MAX_SPIN_COAST=0.4

; Brake torque ramp on coast. 0=no difference, 1=fast wheel twice the speed of slow wheel

BRAKE_TORQUE_POWER=50

; Brake torque to apply to the fastest spinning wheel, on power

BRAKE_TORQUE_COAST=400

; Brake torque to apply to the fastest spinning wheel, on coast

DEAD_ZONE_POWER=0.2

; Dead zone for brake torque ramp on power

DEAD_ZONE_COAST=0.0

; Dead zone for brake torque ramp on coast

; NOTES FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES:
; ========================================
;
; ABS (Anti-lock Braking System):
; - PRESENT=1, ACTIVE=1 - Modern electric vehicles have advanced ABS
; - ABS is crucial for electric vehicles due to regenerative braking integration
; - Works in conjunction with regen braking to optimize stopping power
;
; TRACTION CONTROL:
; - SLIP_RATIO_LIMIT reduced to 0.08 (from 0.12) for more aggressive intervention
; - Electric motors deliver instant torque from 0 RPM, requiring tighter TC control
; - PRESENT=1, ACTIVE=1 - Essential for managing instant torque delivery
; - MIN_SPEED_KMH=5 - TC active at very low speeds to control wheel spin from standstill
;
; EDL (Electronic Differential Lock):
; - PRESENT=0, ACTIVE=0 - Generally not needed with proper electric drivetrain setup
; - Electric vehicles often use individual motor control per wheel (torque vectoring)
; - If your EV has dual motors or torque vectoring, EDL is redundant
;
; Key Differences from Combustion Engines:
; - Instant torque requires more aggressive traction control
; - Regenerative braking integrates with ABS system
; - Power delivery is much more linear and predictable
; - Electronic systems respond faster to electric motor inputs
