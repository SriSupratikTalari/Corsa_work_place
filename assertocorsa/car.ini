[HEADER]
VERSION=2

; SYNTAX: [VERSION=1; 2]. Version of the car that AC loads.

; ▲ It does not represent the development version of the car, but how the AC engine will deal with its physics instead. Acceptable inputs are 1 or 2.
; Default value is 1. In AC 1.16 (first) AC car.ini introduces a preferred VERSION of 2 (RECOMMENDED), for example it adds SHORT_NAME.

[INFO]
SCREEN_NAME=Formula Example 2022 Electric

; Name of the car in UI, on info apps and to identify it on servers.

; ▲ Upper and lowercase characters may be used alongside numbers; special characters may be limited.

SHORT_NAME=FE 22

; Abbreviated label used to the name the car in the race session leaderboards. Available if VERSION=2.

[BASIC]
GRAPHICS_OFFSET=0,-0.370,-0.208646

; 3D axis correction (x,y,z) to move the visual body polygon model in relation to the wheels. [meters]

; ▲ The body is referenced to the center of gravity, or "CG" of the car. This value must be adjusted every time a change to the CG is made.

GRAPHICS_PITCH_ROTATION=0.0

; Changes the pitch of the visual vehicle body. Values >0 bring the front closer to the ground. [deg]

TOTALMASS=1075

; Total mass of vehicle in KG WITHOUT FUEL. Other types of fluids must be included. [kg]

; ▲ The weight of the driver has to be considered equal to 75 kilograms, no more and no less.
; NOTE: Electric vehicles are typically heavier due to battery pack weight

INERTIA=1.0,0.8,2.80

; Dimensions of a box with same momenta of inertia (x,y,z) of the vehicle sprung mass. [m]

; ▲ A solver is able to compute the sprung inertia from total car inertia AUTOMATICALLY IF SET TO 0. Typical values are smaller than the
; physical constraints of the vehicle.

[EXPORT]
INERTIA_INERTIA

; Optional section, introduced with AC 1.15.

INERTIA=1SU,1400,500

; Enables the override of the inertia value and overrides the box inertia parameter.

[GRAPHICS]
DRIVEREYES=0.484284,0.81469,0.16506l

; 3d axis placement (x,y,z) of driver eyes (POV). [m]

STEER_ANIMATION_EXPONENT=1

; Onboard camera exponent for HUD.

OUTBOARD_EXPOSURE=31

; Outboard camera exposure for HDR.

ON_BOARD_EXPOSURE_BLEND=0.583473

; Onboard camera over eyes angle relative to the horizon. [deg]

MIRROR_POSITION=0.0,0.6,0.5

; Position used for the rendered mirror views.

VIRTUAL_MIRROR_ENABLED=0

; Sets if the virtual mirror is enabled (=1) or disabled (=0) - REMOVED FOR ELECTRIC

VIRTUAL_MIRROR_ENABLED=1

; Use virtual mirror in electric vehicles

USE_ANIMATED_SUSPENSIONS=0

; Use animated suspensions (1) or not (0). Animated suspensions will not be updated in real time from
; simulation.

FUEL_LIGHT_MIN_LITERS=0

; Minimum fuel load to activate the Fuel indicator icon - DISABLED FOR ELECTRIC

; ▼ ▼ With the next few parameters you can set the positions of the main vehicle cameras.

BUMPER_CAMERA_POS=0.010,-0.239,0.910

; Bumper camera position. [m]

BUMPER_CAMERA_PITCH=-2.990

; Bumper camera pitch angle. [deg]

BONNET_CAMERA_PITCH=-14.998

; Bonnet camera pitch angle. [deg]

BONNET_CAMERA_POS=0.000,0.940,-0.330

; Bonnet camera position. [m]

CHASE_CAMERA_PITCH=0

; Chase camera pitch angle. [deg]

[CONTROLS]
FFMULT=5.000

; Force Feedback power multiplier - ADJUSTED FOR ELECTRIC MOTOR INSTANT TORQUE

; ▲ Controls the car-specific gain for the Force Feedback, from now on referred to as "FFB". Steering forces are generated via simulation of forces at
; the rack-end positions and depend on the situation of the car and relevant suspension geometry.

STEER_ASSIST=1.000

; Variable steer assist, speed relative.

; ▲ It's a gamma function for load-based effects of FFB. It does NOT determine power steering or anything similar. Values other than 1.0 should generally
; be avoided. The default setting is 1.0, or linear.

; ▼ Think of it like a gamma curve for steering force. Lower values amplify low forces (I think at 0 it just means constant force steering). Only deviate
; from a value of 1 if you know your steering system isn't linear.

STEER_LOCK=440

; Real car's steer lock from center to right. [deg]

; ▲ Controls the in-cockpit steering wheel rotation of the car physics. It must be input in as the real-world value. It's not required that it matches
; the user's simulation peripheral wheel maximum rotation. The input is from center to max angle by 2 to advise for STEER_LOCK.

STEER_RATIO=12.0

; Effective steering ratio of the vehicle, used in solving the roadwheel's steering angle.

; ▲ The real-world race's value should be entered if unsure.

LINEAR_STEER_ROD_RATIO=0.001

; Because of AC complex suspension geometry, you need to calculate manually this value.

; ▲ This line is used to calculate the roadwheel's steering angle. Change the sign of the value (from positive to negative or vice versa) if the car
; steers in the wrong direction, as it is dependent on the location of the steering rack, in front or behind the wheel center. The definition is meters of
; rack travel per degree of steering wheel steering / STEER_RATIO. See the LITTLE EXPLANATION section for more details on how to determine this parameter.

[FUEL]
CONSUMPTION=0.000

; Fuel consumption in liters per second, expressed as a function of rpm=gas*CONSUMPTION/1000. [L/s] - SET TO 0 FOR ELECTRIC

; ▲ If you don't have data, you can estimate the fuel consumption. Good sources are the race leaderboards. Read the LITTLE EXPLANATION and FAQ sections
; for more info.

FUEL=0

; The amount of fuel the car loads in game with at the beginning of every session. [L] - SET TO 0 FOR ELECTRIC

MAX_FUEL=100

; Fuel tank capacity. [L] - KEPT FOR POTENTIAL BATTERY CAPACITY REFERENCE

[FUEL_EXT]
KG_PER_LITER=0.00

; Option for different fuel density, introduced with AC 1.14. [kg/dm^3] - SET TO 0 FOR ELECTRIC

[FUELTANK]
POSITION=0,0.12,-1.72

; Position of fuel mass (tank) from CoG (Center of Gravity). [m]

[RIDE]
PICKUP_FRONT_HEIGHT=0.00

; Height of the front ride height pickup point. [m]

PICKUP_REAR_HEIGHT=0.00

; Height of the rear ride height pickup point; mainly at the front. [m]

; ▲ These lines act as reference point for the ride height values shown inside the setup screens. They are also used for the ride height rules. They're
; referenced from CoG. They do NOT control anything related to the physics.
;
; The values are positive upwards, and set the height at which the ride height is measured for the rule compliance. Measured from the centre of gravity at
; that end of the car. So the height above the ground would be RADIUS + BASEY + PICKUP_FRONT_HEIGHT.

[RULES]
MIN_HEIGHT=0.010

; Setup height rules.
; Minimum front/rear allowed setup ride height, determined by the lines under [RIDE]. [m]

; ▲ If your setup of the car goes under the minimum height, the Drive button will be disabled after a short 5-second check. You can also set this to 0.0
; or omit line.
