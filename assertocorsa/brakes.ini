[HEADER]
VERSION=1

; ▲ VERSION=2 enables temperatures for brakes (with phys. undocumented)

[DATA]
MAX_TORQUE=1200

; Maximum brake torque. [Nm] - REDUCED FOR ELECTRIC (regen braking does significant work)

; ▲ 100% brake pedal input will give you this torque value. This is the resistance made by the brakes on the axle. So it's not really like a real brake
; pedal.

FRONT_SHARE=0.62

; Percentage of brake torque at front axis. - ADJUSTED FOR ELECTRIC (regen often biased to rear/front depending on motor placement)

; ▲ This is the default value for the brake bias. It's the one you can find in setup screens, if the bias adjustment is available.

HANDBRAKE_TORQUE=0

; Handbrake torque for the rear wheels: 0= no handbrake. [Nm] - CAN KEEP AT 0 OR ADJUST

COCKPIT_ADJUSTABLE=1

; 0= no bias control from cockpit, 1= bias control from cockpit.

ADJUST_STEP=0.5

; Step for bias adjustment from the cockpit (how much each click/button push changes the bias).

[DISCS_GRAPHICS]

; Lines for the brake disc glow at high temperatures.

; ▲ The brake disk glow works only if you applied the ksBrakeDisc shader to your disc meshes (this implies also the textures for disc glow). New part:

DISC_RF=dj_Disk_RF

; Specifies the mesh name for front right that will glow.

DISC_RF=dj_Disk_RF

; " " right front disc mesh " "

DISC_LF=dj_Disk_LR

; " " left rear disc mesh " "

DISC_RR=dj_Disk_RR

; " " right rear disc mesh " "

FRONT_MAX_GLOW=60.0

; Max emission value the front brakes will have at full heat.

REAR_MAX_GLOW=24.0

; Max emission value the rear brakes

LAG_HOT=0.995

; Amount of filtering interpolation lag used while making the brakes brighten.

; ▲ Refers to the difference in time between when the disc is normal and when it reaches glowing temperature while braking.

LAG_COOL=0.98

; Amount of filtering interpolation lag used while spinning up the turbo

; ▲ Refers to the difference in time between when the disc is glowing and when it goes back to normal after releasing the brakes.

; =============================================
; ELECTRIC VEHICLE BRAKE SYSTEM NOTES:
; =============================================
;
; KEY MODIFICATIONS FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES:
;
; 1. REDUCED MAX_TORQUE (1200 Nm instead of 1400)
;    - Electric vehicles use regenerative braking for significant stopping power
;    - Mechanical brakes do less work, especially at low-medium speeds
;    - Regen can provide 50-70% of braking force in normal driving
;
; 2. ADJUSTED FRONT_SHARE (0.62)
;    - Balance adjusted for regenerative braking integration
;    - Depends on motor placement (front/rear/dual motor)
;    - Front-motor EVs: more front bias
;    - Rear-motor EVs: can be more balanced due to rear regen
;    - Dual-motor EVs: even more balanced
;
; 3. BRAKE TEMPERATURE AND WEAR:
;    - Electric vehicle brakes run COOLER than combustion vehicles
;    - Less brake usage due to regen means:
;      * Lower operating temperatures
;      * Much longer brake pad life (100k+ miles common)
;      * Less brake dust
;    - You may want to reduce glow values if simulating realistic EV brake temps
;
; 4. BRAKE FEEL:
;    - Electric vehicles often have different brake pedal feel
;    - "Blended braking" combines regen + friction braking
;    - Initial pedal input = regen only
;    - Heavy pedal input = regen + mechanical brakes
;
; 5. COCKPIT_ADJUSTABLE=1:
;    - Keeping adjustable brake bias for track/performance use
;    - In real EVs, bias is often electronically controlled automatically
;
; IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS:
; - Regen braking is handled by the ERS system (ers.ini)
; - This file defines MECHANICAL brake behavior only
; - Total braking force = mechanical (this file) + regenerative (ers.ini)
; - At high speeds or emergency braking, mechanical brakes provide majority of force
; - At low speeds, regen provides most braking (mechanical brakes barely used)
;
; TUNING TIPS:
; - If brakes feel too weak: increase MAX_TORQUE
; - If rear locks up too easily: increase FRONT_SHARE
; - If front locks up too easily: decrease FRONT_SHARE
; - Balance should account for regen braking bias from ers.ini
