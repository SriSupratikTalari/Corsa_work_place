; MGU-K configuration - ADJUSTED FOR ELECTRIC REGEN BRAKING

TORQUE_CURVE=kers_torque.lut

; File reference for the torque curve LUT in Nm/RPM - USED FOR REGEN BRAKING POWER

COAST_CURVE=kers_torque_coast.lut

; Coast Torque curve Nm/RPM - REGEN BRAKING CURVE

DISCHARGE_TIME=120000

; Time to discharge the MGU-K or KERS, when used to deliver torque. [ms] - INCREASED FOR LARGER BATTERY CAPACITY

HAS_BUTTON_OVERRIDE=0

; Boolean - SET TO 0 FOR ELECTRIC (NO MANUAL BOOST BUTTON, POWER ALWAYS AVAILABLE)

MAX_KJ_PER_LAP=999999

; Maximum energy discharge allowed per lap, given by race regulations. [kJ] - SET VERY HIGH FOR ELECTRIC (ESSENTIALLY UNLIMITED)

DEFAULT_CONTROLLER=0

; Values: 0= 1= - KEEP AT 0

BRAKE_REAR_CORRECTION=35

; Torque removed from rear axle as function of kinetic recovery. [Nm] - ADJUSTED FOR REGEN BRAKING FEEL

[HEAT]
CHARGE_K=0.001

; MGU-H configuration - NOT USED IN PURE ELECTRIC (NO TURBO), BUT KEPT FOR BATTERY HEAT MANAGEMENT

TORQUE_PERC=5

; % of torque the Heat is able to generate from the kinetic motor - REDUCED FOR ELECTRIC (MINIMAL HEAT RECOVERY)

[COCKPIT_CONTROLS]
RECOVERY=0

; Specify if the controls below should be available for cockpit operation.
; Boolean logic operator: 0=False, 1=True - SET TO 0 FOR ELECTRIC (REGEN IS AUTOMATIC)

DELIVERY_PROFILE=1

; Delivery profile control - CAN ENABLE FOR POWER MODES

MGU_H_MODE=0

; MGU-H mode - SET TO 0 FOR ELECTRIC (NO MGU-H IN PURE ELECTRIC)

LITTLE EXPLANATION

- For a pure electric vehicle, the ERS system represents:
  * Battery discharge (delivering power to motors)
  * Regenerative braking (recovering energy when braking)
  * Battery capacity and thermal management

- Key modifications for electric:
  * DISCHARGE_TIME increased to 120000ms (2 minutes) - represents much larger battery capacity
  * MAX_KJ_PER_LAP set very high (999999) - no race regulation limits for road cars
  * HAS_BUTTON_OVERRIDE=0 - power is always available, no manual boost button
  * RECOVERY=0 - regenerative braking is automatic, not manually adjustable
  * CHARGE_K adjusted for electric motor regen characteristics
  * BRAKE_REAR_CORRECTION tuned for regen braking feel

- The KERS torque curves control how much regenerative braking is applied
- MGU-H is disabled (set to minimal values) as there's no turbo/heat recovery in pure electric
- The system now represents battery energy management rather than F1-style hybrid boost
